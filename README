DESCRIPTION
The autocmds in this script automatically trigger the IndentConsistencyCop for
certain, configurable filetypes (such as c, cpp, html, xml, ... which
typically contain lots of indented lines) once when you load the file in Vim,
and (optionally) also on every write of the buffer. The entire buffer will be
checked for inconsistent indentation, and you will receive a report on its
findings. With this automatic background check, you'll become aware of
indentation problems before you start editing and in case you accidentally
introduce an inconsistency with your edits.

USAGE
Triggering happens automatically; of course, you can still manually execute
the :IndentConsistencyCop command to re-check the buffer at any time.

For very large files, the check may take a couple of seconds. You can abort
the script run with CTRL-C, like any other Vim command.

If you chose to "Ignore" any inconsistent indents in the IndentConsistencyCop
report, further automatic invocations on buffer writes are suspended. It is
assumed that you don't bother for this particular file. You can re-enable
automatic invocations by manually invoking :IndentConsistencyCop once and then
choosing an option other than "Ignore".

:IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOff
:IndentConsistencyCopAutoCmdsOn
                        Disable / re-enable the autocommands. This affects all
                        existing buffers as well as any newly opened files.
